# InteractionPredcition

## Abstract
On-going project on early diagnosis of psychiatric disorders using interaction level as a marker. Through monitoring daily 
activities of subjects and track their interaction levels, detect any unusual changes as early sign of disorders.

Collavboration with Professor Thivya Kandappu at SMU, and Vigneshwaran Subbaraju from ASTAR.


## Dataset
We collected and annotated a new dataset called R3 (Record, REtrieve and REplay). Dataset consists of photo streams captured at 2 fpm by an ego-centric camera at chest level while the camera wearer (CW) performs their daily routines. It contains lifelogs of 42 camera wearers.


## Model Architecture
For the detailed model description, refer to the slides at [Proposed Model for Interaction Detection](https://github.com/GakkiChen/InteractionPredcition/blob/main/img/Model%20Explained.pptx)
